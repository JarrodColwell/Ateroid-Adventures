# Asteroid-Adventures

With recent developments in Virtual Reality, our team wanted to gain hands-on experience with some of its new technology. Using Leap Motion hardware and Unity, our team built a Desktop Game where the user controls the player using hand motions. Our application helps to merge the virtual with reality in an interactive game.

Acting as a Robotic Collector in space, the user must catch asteriods while avoiding dangerous debris. The Robotic Arms are remotely operated using a Leap Motion sensor for hand motions. The more asteriods a player collects before running out of lives, the higher they score!

This project was built in Unity with C# and incorporated Leap Motion hardware. We experimented with the implementation of Leap Motion Hardware and decided to create an interactive game. We split the project into seperate components like objects detecting touch, deletion, and constant motion. We combined our knowledge and C# code to create a working prototype of the game. Some final touches included the addition of multiple lives, a score counter, asteroid and space sprites.
